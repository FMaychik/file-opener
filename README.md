## Why it?
I did this project for fun for my convenience (Although itâ€™s easier to open the file by clicking the mouse). In future, I can add more extensions (.doc, .py and etc.). Yeah, there A LOT OF BUGS, but I'll fix it (it can be not 100%).
## Modules
- Tkinter (main module) - ui
- Tkinter (ttk) - fresh ui
